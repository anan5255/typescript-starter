A. Project: Task Manager
This project is a task management system built with NestJS. It provides a REST API to manage a collection of tasks, each with a unique identifier, title, description, status, creation date, and update date. The application uses NestJS modules, providers, and decorators to implement the feature and includes unit and integration tests for adequate test coverage.

B. Features:
Create a new task
Retrieve a task by its id
Delete a task by its id
